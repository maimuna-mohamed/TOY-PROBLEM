# Speed Detector

This JavaScript software takes a car's speed as input and calculates demerit points if it exceeds the 70 km/h limit set by Kenyan traffic regulations.

## How it works.

- If speed is <= 70, output "Ok".
- One demerit point is assessed for every 5 km/h above 70.
- If demerit points exceed 12, display "License suspended".

## How To Use

1. Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser.
2. Enter the vehicle's speed when prompted.
3. The outcome will be shown as an alert.
